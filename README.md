# IMG Browser with uploading option

The website displays some simple dynamic data and img files from a json database, and you can upload new picture and delete from the database.

The goal was to practice basic backend side programming (JavaScript) by creating endpoints to my fetch requests, and how to handle post/delete requests.

- Sending GET and POST and DELETE requests.

# Technologies used:
